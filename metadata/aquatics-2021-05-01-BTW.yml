#INITIAL CONDITIONS
#Uncertainty in the initialization of state variables (Y). Initial condition
#uncertainty will be a common feature of any dynamic model, where the future
#state depends on the current state, such as population models, process-based
#biogeochemical pool & flux models, and classic time-series analysis.
#
#complexity = number of state variables in the model. Examples of this would be the number of
#species in a community model, number of age/size classes in a population model,
#number of pools in a biogeochemical model.
    initial_conditions:
      status: absent #options: absent, present, data_driven, propagates, assimilates
      complexity: 0 #How many models states need initial conditions
      propagation:
        type: ensemble #How does your model propogate initial conditions (ensemble or MCMC is most common)
        size: 2000. #number of ensemble or MCMC members

      assimilation:
        type: refit #description of assimilation method
        reference: "NA" #reference for assimilation method
        complexity: 4 #number of states that are updated with assimilation
#
#DRIVERS
#uncertainty in model drivers, covariates, and exogenous scenarios (X).
#Driver/covariate uncertainties may come directly from a data product, as a
#reported error estimate or through driver ensembles, or may be estimated based
#on sampling theory, cal/val documents, or some other source.
#
#complexity = Number of different driver variables or covariates in a model. For example, in
#a multiple regression this would be the number of X’s. For a climate-driven
#model, this would be the number of climate inputs (temperature, precip, solar
#radiation, etc.).

#
#PARAMETERS
#Uncertainty in model parameters (). For most ecological processes the parameters
#(a.k.a. coefficients) in model equations are not physical constants but need to
#be estimated from data.
#
#complexity = number of estimated parameters/coefficients in a model at a single point in
#space/time. For example, in a regression it would be the number of beta’s.

#
#RANDOM EFFECTS
#Unexplained variability and heterogeneity in model parameters (). Hierarchical
#models, random effect models, and meta transfer learning approaches all attempt
#to acknowledge that the ‘best’ model parameters may change across space, time,
#individual, or other measurement unit.

#complexity = number of random effect terms, which should be equivalent to the number of
#random effect variances estimated. For example, if you had a hierarchical
#univariate regression with a random intercept you would have two parameters
#(slope and intercept) and one random effect (intercept). At the moment, we are
#not recording the number of distinct observation units that the model was
#calibrated from. So, in our random intercept regression example, if this model
#was fit at 50 sites to be able to estimate the random intercept variance, that
#would affect the uncertainty about the mean and variance but that ‘50’ would
#not be part of the complexity dimensions.

#
#PROCESS ERROR
#Dynamic uncertainty in the process model () attributable to both model
#misspecification and stochasticity. Pragmatically, this is the portion of the
#residual error from one timestep to the next that is not attributable to any of
#the other uncertainties listed above, and which typically propagates into the future.
#
#complexity =  dimension of the error covariance matrix. So if we had a n x n
#covariance matrix, n is the value entered for <complexity>. Typically n should
#match the dimensionality of the initial_conditions unless there are state
#variables where process error is not being estimated or propagated

#
#OBSERVATION ERROR
#Uncertainty in the observations of the output variables (g). Note that many
#statistical modeling approaches do not formally partition errors in observations
#from errors in the modeling process, but simply lump these into a residual error.
#Because of this we make the pragmatic distinction and ask that residual errors
#that a forecast model do not directly propagate into the future be recorded as
#observation errors. Observation errors now may indeed affect the initial condition
#uncertainty in the next forecast, but we consider this to be indirect.
